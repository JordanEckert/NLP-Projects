# Reddit-NLP-Project
This repository is a variation of my internship work for Summer 2022 at Regions Bank. For the summer, I learned about natural language processing (NLP) in order to help support the Region's data science team in increasing the efficacy of various customer service models. 

This repository is split into two separate NLP projects - topic modeling and sentiment analysis.
